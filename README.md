The Challenge

The Data Centre that the company is currently using is closing down. The data centre supports three offices in Christchurch, Auckland and Melbourne, and 51 other small  sites across New Zealand and Melbourne. We currently have 250 servers including domain controllers, sql servers and general application servers. We have selected Fortinet as our firewall supplier and use Citrix SD-WAN for connectivity. A disaster recovery solution is required, 5 applications are considered critical and need to be recovered within 4 hours and the others by next business day.

 

Please make an appropriate recommendation and design for an Azure cloud production environment with full DR, considering the following aspects:

    High level design
    Security
    DR
    Cost Management
    Governance
    Network configuration
    What resourcing, team composition and investments would be required?
    How would you gain buy-in and support from the team?
